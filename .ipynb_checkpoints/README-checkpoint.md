# Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude) Challenge 

The finalized dashboard may be viewed at [https://szerpa17.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/](https://szerpa17.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/).

## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard 

Created individual pages for each weather scatter plot and a means by which users can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. Users will also have access to a landing page, a page where they can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where they can view the data used to build the plots.

### Website Requirements

The website consist of 7 pages total, including:

* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page with a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and linked images that take the user to the appropriate visualization.
* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations that is reactive to small screens.
* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

The website has a navigation menu at every page that:

* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
* Is responsive (using media queries). 

### Screenshots
